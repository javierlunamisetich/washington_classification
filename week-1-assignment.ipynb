Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model. Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review. Given the logistic regression weights, predictors and ground truth labels, write a function to compute the accuracy of the model. Inspect the coefficients of the logistic regression model and interpret their meanings. Compare multiple logistic regression models."

    "We will now compute the word count for each word that appears in the reviews. A vector consisting of word counts is often referred to as bag-of-word features. Since most words occur in only a few reviews, word count vectors are sparse. For this reason, scikit-learn and many other tools use sparse matrices to store a collection of word count vectors. Refer to appropriate manuals to produce sparse word count vectors. General steps for extracting word count vectors are as follows:\n",
